            The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son
            ichael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. T hrough
            Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head
            of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything
            stands against the good of the family.

            Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito
            Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the dark side of
            the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local
            Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood
            in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business.
            With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.

            After a break of more than 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third
            and final story of the fictional Corleone crime family. Two decades have passed, and crime kingpin Michael Corleone,
            now divorced from his wife Kay has nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his family would one day be completely
            legitimate.
